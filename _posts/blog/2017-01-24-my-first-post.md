Hi reader..!
This is my first post on this blog. I created this blog to contribute my work with others and get connected with other people. I like surfing the Internet and explore new ideas. I also love to contribute to Open Source Software Development and learn more about different projects.

Currently I am enrolled in B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="http://www.glbitm.org">G.L.Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management,Greater Noida</a> in Third Semester.I am currently pursuing Data Structures and Algorithms, Application Programming, and Digital Design courses in my college. Apart from this I like to learn new computer languages.
In my free time I like to play instruments, listen songs and read poetries ;) .
